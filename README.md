# Cloud Native Days Manifesto

Cloud Native Days is a global initiative aimed at fostering innovation, collaboration, and community-building within the cloud-native ecosystem. Our mission is to empower developers, technologists, and organizations by promoting open-source cloud native technology, supporting local communities, and enabling international collaboration through a series of global events.

## Our core principles

1. **Stay Open Source and transparent**
   We believe that open-source is the backbone of cloud-native technologies. Cloud Native Days events are dedicated to promoting and showcasing open-source solutions, to enable contribution and ensure that innovation remains accessible to all.
   Every decision, process, and initiative associated with Cloud Native Days will be conducted transparently. We will openly share resources, methodologies and results through transparency reports, allowing the community to really participate and hold us accountable.

2. **Support Cloud Native technologies:**
   Cloud Native Days is committed to advocate for the adoption and continuous improvement of cloud-native technologies, including but not limited to containerization, Kubernetes, microservices, serverless and AI.
   Our events will provide deep technical sessions, workshops, hands-on labs and keynotes to help attendees navigate and get practical knowledge in cloud native, ensuring they are fully equipped to bring innovation in their companies.

3. **Community above all**
   We recognize the importance of local communities in driving a global change. Cloud Native Days will support and empower local leaders, providing them with the tools, resources, and platforms needed to organize events and maximize engagement in their regions.
   We are also dedicated to creating an inclusive environment that welcomes each participant regardless of their background, culture and experience. Our events will actively encourage diverse voices and perspectives, ensuring everyone gets to be represented in the community.

4. **International collaboration:**
   Cloud Native Days is a global network of events that transcends borders. We encourage sharing knowledge, expertise, organizers, speakers and resources across different regions, creating a unified global community that can win together.
   Connecting local communities and empower our team of proven international cloud native leaders, together we will create events that will benefit the entire cloud-native ecosystem.

**Call to action!**
We invite developers, engineers, entrepreneurs, and cloud natives worldwide to join us in building a vibrant, open, and collaborative cloud native future. Whether you're attending, organizing, or speaking at Cloud Native Days, your contribution always matters. Together, we will shape the future of cloud computing, one event at a time.
