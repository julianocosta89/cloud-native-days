# Cloud Native Days Manifesto

Having organized Cloud Native and community events for quite a while, we, the organizers, felt the urge to come up with a new series of independent events, with a strong focus on the local community and the maximum amount of agency for local organizers on how to handle event dates, insurance, tooling, ticketing systems, sponsorships, and above all, how to handle attendee data. We believe that no one knows their community better than the people living in it on a daily basis.

Cloud Native Days is a new global initiative, born in the vibrant European Cloud Native ecosystem, which aims to foster collaboration and community-building within the cloud native ecosystem, with a focus on community events.

Our mission is to empower attendees, speakers, and sponsors alike by promoting open-source cloud native technology, supporting local communities, and enabling international collaboration through global events.

## Our core principles

1. **Stay Open Source and transparent**
   We believe that open-source is the backbone of cloud native technologies. Cloud Native Days events are dedicated to promoting and showcasing open-source solutions to enable contribution and ensure that innovation remains accessible to all.
   Every decision, process, and initiative associated with Cloud Native Days will be conducted transparently. We will openly share resources, methodologies, and results through transparency reports, allowing the community to truly participate and hold us accountable.

2. **Support Cloud Native technologies:**
   Cloud Native Days is committed to advocating for the adoption and continuous improvement of cloud native technologies, including but not limited to containerization, Kubernetes, microservices, serverless, and AI.
   Our events will provide deep technical sessions, workshops, hands-on labs, and keynotes to help attendees navigate and gain practical knowledge in cloud native, ensuring they are fully equipped to bring innovation to their companies.

3. **Community above all**
   We recognize the importance of local communities in driving global change. Cloud Native Days will support and empower local leaders, providing them with the tools, resources, and platforms needed to organize events and maximize engagement in their regions.
   We are also dedicated to creating an inclusive environment that welcomes each participant regardless of their background, culture, and experience. Our events will actively encourage diverse voices and perspectives, ensuring everyone gets to be represented in the community.

4. **International collaboration:**
   Cloud Native Days is a global network of events that transcends borders. We encourage sharing knowledge, expertise, organizers, speakers, and resources across different regions, creating a unified global community that can win together.
   By connecting local communities and empowering our team of proven international cloud native leaders, together we will create events that will benefit the entire cloud native ecosystem.
